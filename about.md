# About Spotrot.TTC

Spotrot.TTC is a simple web app designed to help riders of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) quickly access information and send messages related to specific stops. 

## Motivation

This project was born out of a need for a quick and easy way to Check the status of a TTC stop (e.g., is it accessible, are there any delays?). I find google maps arrivals different from realty sometimes. TXTTTC seems to be reliable for now

## Features

The app provides a user-friendly interface with the following features:

* **Grid of Stops:** Displays a list of TTC stops with basic information.
* **Quick Messaging:** Allows users to send a pre-filled message containing the stop ID to TXTTTC.
* **Search Functionality:** Enables users to easily find specific stops by searching for keywords.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Automatically adjusts the app's appearance based on the time of day for optimal viewing.

## Disclaimer

This is **not an official TTC app**. It is an independent project developed to provide a convenient tool for TTC riders.  For official information and updates, please refer to the [TTC website](https://www.ttc.ca).
